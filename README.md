Machine learning case studies and references

I had signed up for an extensive online course at https://www.appliedaicourse.com.
* Firstly it is a brilliant course with 150+ hours of AI/ML content with simple explanations and diagrams.
* Secondly at the end of each topic/section there are a couple of assignments the tutors expect students to solve.
These solutions are reviewed and corrections are suggested until the tutors(who are experts in the field of applied AI) are satisfied.
* Thirdly there are also many case studies solving real world problems. Most of these problems are picked up from kaggle competitions. 
The case studies do not try to beat the winner of the competition, but it is an attempt to understand the concepts applied by 
several brilliant competitors and a comphrehensive comparision between these concept's results. 
The students of this course are expected to tweak the solutions untill the loss or accuracy reaches below the threshold set by the tutors.
* Fourthly the neural network case studies are run on collab.reasearch.google.com as my compute power was not sufficient to train complex
and deep neural networks. 
* Finally this repo includes my attempt at adding new solutions and tweaking the existing solutions to better the results.

### __Organization of the iPynb file content__

* The problem statement is clearly explained with referenced to the data source
* Data cleaning and preprocessing 
* Exploratory, Univariate and Multivariate feature analysis
* Time series analysis when applicable
* Feature extraction
* Fourier transform for time series data
* Train set split
* Data normalization/standardization
* Different supervised or unsupervised models are trained are hyperparameter tuned
* Each model's accuracy or loss is measured against the test data
* Comparision of each model in a tabular format
* Highlight the best model and the result
